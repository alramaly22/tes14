        testimonial2: "Hey Omar, how are you? Honestly, everything is going great. The meal plan and workout routine are amazing. I can't believe I lost 10 kg of fat without feeling deprived of anything! My diet and physique have completely changed, and the difference is clearly visible in the pictures. It was truly an honor working with you during this period. You have great taste, you're very respectful, and you never hesitate to provide any information. Mashallah, you understand everything and are really skilled. My mindset about food and dieting has completely changed. Now, I eat well and properly while understanding exactly what goes into my body. I calculate everything, and I no longer stress about whether eating something will make me gain weight or ruin my diet. Before, I used to regain the weight I lost because I didn't understand things properly. Now, exercise has become an essential part of my daily routine, and I can't imagine my life without it. Honestly, everything about you is amazing. May God bless you! Thank you for everything and for all the effort you put in with me. I truly appreciate it",
        testimonial3: "Noran Marwan",
        testimonial4: "Coach, if you only knew how much you've changed things I once thought were impossible! Whenever I heard people talk about a healthy lifestyle, I used to imagine it as something extremely difficult that required immense strength and determination‚Äîsomething I never thought I had. But you truly made it simple for me. Even on days when I struggled to stay committed, you always made it feel manageable and not like a big deal. Thank you so much! üåπ At first, I just wanted to see how far I could go in reducing my body fat percentage. But honestly, I had completely lost hope in losing weight due to all the health issues I was dealing with. When I once visited a gynecologist, she advised me to see a surgeon and undergo a gastric sleeve surgery. And when I went to the surgeon, he actually turned me away! ü§£ü§£ I even considered other procedures like the balloon or smart capsule, thinking they were my only options. But now, I'm so grateful! I've already lost 15 kg, and my goal is to reach 25 kg. Thanks to God, I'm in great health, feeling amazing, and still progressing. May God bless you for all your efforts‚Äîyou never fail to support me! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüåπüåπüåπ",

        testimonial6: "Coach, I swear, in just a few weeks, my body has completely transformed‚Äî180 degrees! I can't even describe how happy I am with the results! My stomach and waist look completely different‚Äîit's unbelievable! My body has changed so much that I've reached a level I never thought possible. Today at the gym, everyone was commenting on my progress, asking me how I managed to achieve this transformation. When someone truly gets inside your head, motivates you, and guides you properly, you realize the process is actually much easier and faster than you ever imagined‚Äîespecially when that person is as incredible as you. Thank you so much, truly! Every single word or piece of advice you gave me, I took to heart and applied exactly as you said. And honestly, that's what made all the difference for me‚Äîit was all about mindset and following what you taught me!",
        testimonial7: "Talia Youssef",
        testimonial8: "The  transformation has been incredible! My body shape has changed so much, even though I wasn't fully committed to training and diet. If I had been more disciplined, the results would have been even better! My skin has also improved significantly‚Äîsomething I didn't expect at all! At first, the workout schedule overwhelmed me üòÇ, but later, I actually started enjoying it. The training is well-structured and makes a huge difference. As for food, I was amazed that I could still eat what I love without a complicated diet plan. Understanding that I can enjoy my meals made the whole journey much easier and more comfortable for me. Honestly, everything has been great! The only issue was the time difference, which sometimes delayed responses, but that's totally fine. Most importantly, you're professional, respectful, and genuinely dedicated to helping people. You never hold back any valuable information, and that's exactly why I decided to sign up with you. ‚ù§Ô∏èüôèüèªüôèüèª",

You are an outstanding and successful person, and I genuinely wish you more success. I have changed so much, and I now feel a level of confidence I never had before‚Äîall because of you and what I've learned from you. I never knew how to eat properly, but now I've learned how to eat well without depriving myself. I can't even explain exactly what you did, but I'm extremely happy with the results and continuing my journey because of you. Your professionalism is incredible‚Äîany time I asked you something, you always had the right answer. Despite my busy schedule and all the challenges, I still achieved amazing results, and I'm truly happy about it.
